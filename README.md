Face tracking laser turret.

This is my fork of Micheal Reeves Laser turret project, but this time it actually has face tracking.

This project uses EmguCV To track faces and Arduino to control the servo's over a Serial Port.


You need an Arduino to pass the signals from your computer to the servo's. For the hardware part you can follow Micheal's Tutorial to setup. Its exactly the same as this is a fork of the software. 
For example the Arduino code is exactly the same.
